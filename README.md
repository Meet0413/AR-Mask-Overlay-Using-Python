**Real-Time Face Mask Overlay**

**Overview**

This repository contains a Python script using the OpenCV library to perform real-time face detection from a webcam feed and overlay a mask on the detected faces. The code is designed to demonstrate a simple application of computer vision in augmenting faces with masks, showcasing the capabilities of OpenCV.

**Features**

- Real-time face detection using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier.
- Overlaying a mask on detected faces in the webcam feed.
- Adjustable parameters for face detection (scale factor, minimum neighbors).
- Supports any mask with an alpha channel for transparency.

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)

**Usage**



1. Install dependencies:

    
    pip install opencv-python
    

2. Run the script:

    python real-time-face-mask-overlay
    

3. Quit the application:

    Press 'q' to exit the application.




**Virtual Reality Face Mask Overlay VR**




**Introduction**

**Prerequisites**
•	Python 3.x
•	OpenCV (install with pip install opencv-python)



**Usage**
1.	Clone the Repository:
•	VR-Mask-Overlay-Using-Python
2.	Install Dependencies:
•	pip install opencv-python 
3.	Run the Script:
•	python vr-face-mask-overlay.py 
4.	Quit the Application:
•	Press the 'q' key to exit the VR face mask overlay.
